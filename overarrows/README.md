# overarrows - Custom extensible arrows over math expressions

## Presentation

A LaTeX package to create custom arrows over math expressions, mainly for
vectors (but arrows can as well be drawn below). Arrows stretch with content,
scale with math styles, and have a correct kerning when a subscript follows.
Some predefined commands are also provided.
